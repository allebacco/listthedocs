# List The Docs

List The Docs allows to collect the documentation of projects hosted in
different servers in the same page.

List The Docs does not (actually) provides documentation hosting, but it
offer only a web page with a nice list of project and documentation links.

This work has been started from [Host the Docs](https://github.com/rgalanakis/hostthedocs),
but has lead to a complete rewrite of the code and the aim of the project.

The project is written in Python using Flask.
