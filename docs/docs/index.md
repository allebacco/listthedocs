# List The Docs

List The Docs allows you to collect in the same page the documentation of
different projects hosted on different servers.

See the full project documentation [here](https://allebacco.github.io/listthedocs/).

This work has been inspired from [Host the Docs](https://github.com/rgalanakis/hostthedocs),
but change in the aim of the project has lead to a complete rewrite of the
source code.

The project is written in Python using Flask.
