# Python Client

To simplify the interaction with the rest APIs, List The Docs provides a
Python client. The following line will load it and its entities.

``` python
from listthedocs.client import ListTheDocs, Project, Version
```

## Entities

The Python client defines two entities: ``Project`` and ``Version``.

## Client

The ``ListTheDocs`` class defines all the functions needed to manage
the ``Project`` and ``Version`` entities.
